# Social Media Post Scheduling Tool

## Feature
A basic tool that allows users to schedule posts on popular social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

## Value Proposition
Many individuals and small businesses struggle to maintain a consistent social media presence due to time constraints or inconsistent posting habits. This tool simplifies the process by allowing users to schedule posts in advance, ensuring a steady stream of content without requiring constant attention.

## How it Works
Users would create an account, connect their social media accounts, and then schedule posts using a simple calendar interface. They could compose their posts, add images or links, and specify the date and time for each post to be published. The tool would then automatically publish the posts at the scheduled times.

## Target Market
Small businesses, freelancers, influencers, and individuals who manage their own social media accounts and are looking for a simple and affordable way to schedule posts in advance.

## Pricing
A one-time fee of around $20 for access to the basic scheduling functionality. Additional features, such as analytics or support for more social media platforms, could be offered as premium upgrades at an additional cost.

**This simple product addresses a specific pain point for its target audience and provides a solution at an affordable price point.**

## Tech Stack
Node.js with Express for the backend, PostgreSQL for the database, and React with Vite for the frontend:

### Backend (Node.js with Express)

- Node.js with Express to create a RESTful API to handle authentication, scheduling posts, and interacting with the database.
- Implement user authentication and authorization using libraries like Passport.js or JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure access to the scheduling functionality.
- Set up routes and controllers to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing user accounts and scheduled posts.
- Utilize middleware for input validation, error handling, and any additional security measures.
- Use Mongoose as an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library to interact with the MongoDB database, making it easier to perform database operations in a Node.js environment.

### Database (MongoDB)

- Set up a MongoDB database to store user account information, scheduled posts, and any other relevant data.
- Define database schemas and tables for users, posts, and any additional entities needed for your application.
- Use features such as foreign keys, indexes, and constraints to enforce data integrity and optimize query performance.
- Consider implementing database backups and monitoring to ensure data reliability and availability.

### Frontend (React with Vite)

- Create a React application using Vite as the build tool for fast development and optimized builds.
- Design and implement a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and scheduling posts.
- Utilize React Router for navigation between different pages or views within the application.
- Implement form validation and error handling to provide a smooth user experience.
- Use Axios or Fetch API to make HTTP requests to the backend API for authentication and data retrieval.
- Consider integrating UI libraries like Material-UI or Ant Design for pre-designed components and a consistent design language.

### Development and Deployment

- Set up a development environment with hot reloading for both the backend and frontend to speed up the development process.
- Use Git for version control and collaborate with your team members efficiently.
- Deploy your backend application to a platform like Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and your frontend application to a static hosting service like Vercel or Netlify.
- Configure CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines to automate the deployment process and ensure smooth updates to your production environment.
